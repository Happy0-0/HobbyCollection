    * As a User

4. Class Diagram
    * UML-based class diagram.
    * Class Diagram Description: One or two lines for each class to describe use of interfaces,  classes and resources, interfaces, etc. Don't worry about putting more than a        few words to each class; this does not need to be thorough.
5. JSON Schema
    * Your project should have an REST endpoint that emits JSON, which another group can consume.  The design document should contain a draft JSON schema for this endpoint.
    * You can create a schema from a Java class at QuickType.io.  This Java class is typically a DTO.  That's all you need at this point.

    * UI Specialist: Ben Romig
    * Business Logic and Persistence Specialist: Steve Meckstroth
