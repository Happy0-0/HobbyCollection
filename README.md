# HobbyCollection
Github page for HobbyCollection. A website to record all your favorite collections!
1. Introduction
    * 
2. Storyboard (screen mockups): Invision, FluidUI, Powerpoint, paint, etc... will be fine.
3. Functional Requirements in the format (fill in the square brackets with your own words):
    * As a User
    * I want to be able to save an image.
    * So that I can save it on a website
    * As a User
    * I want to add descriptions and tags to the images
    * So that I can search and filter the images.
    * As a User
    * I want to have a homepage where I can look at my whole collection.
    * So that I can save it on a website
    * Elaborate each of these with several examples in this format:
      * Given an image
      * When uploaded, saved.
      * Then you can view the image on the website
      * Given a tag
      * When applied to an image information
      * Then you can see the tag in the image information.
      * Given a homepage
      * When I click on the homepage
      * Then I should see images of my collection.
4. Class Diagram
    * UML-based class diagram.
    * Class Diagram Description: One or two lines for each class to describe use of interfaces,  classes and resources, interfaces, etc. Don't worry about putting more than a        few words to each class; this does not need to be thorough.
5. JSON Schema
    * Your project should have an REST endpoint that emits JSON, which another group can consume.  The design document should contain a draft JSON schema for this endpoint.
    * You can create a schema from a Java class at QuickType.io.  This Java class is typically a DTO.  That's all you need at this point.
6. Scrum Roles, and who will fill those roles
    * UI Specialist: Ben Romig
    * Business Logic and Persistence Specialist: Steve Meckstroth
    * Product Owner/Scrum Master/DevOps: Gabriel Levit
    * Requirements Analyst: Allie Prusha

9) Meets at Wednesday 5:00pm weekly.
